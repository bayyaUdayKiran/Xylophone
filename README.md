# xylophone

A Simple Xylophone App made with üíôÔ∏è from INDIA.



- Hey, codeors here I made a Xylophone App, not too complex, but beautiful and functional
- Just, try clicking on the color tabs every color tab plays a different sound.
- It might take a little time for playing  the music notes for the 1st time, but as going on you will not face this latency problem.

- The 1st time music playing delay time caused, because I used the [Audioplayers][1] package to play the music.
