A Simple Xylophone App made with üíôÔ∏è from INDIA.



- Hey, codeors here I made a Xylophone App, not too complex, but beautiful and functional
- Just, try clicking on the color tabs every color tab plays a different sound.
- It might take a little time for playing all the music notes for the 1st time, but as going on you will not face this problem.

- The 1st time music playing delay time causes because I used the audioplayers package to know much more info https://pub.dev/packages/audioplayers


Made with Love from INDIA...
